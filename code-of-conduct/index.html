                        <p>Rocky Python is a community intended for learning, networking, and collaboration and has members with different backgrounds and perspectives from all over the greater Denver area and beyond.</p>

                        <p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to organizers as well as members. Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.</p>

                        <p>This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate. This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Rocky Python. This includes Discord, mailing lists, and virtual or in-person events. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.</p>

                        <p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing <a href="mailto: rockypython@googlegroups.com">rockypython@googlegroups.com</a>.</p>


<ul>
  <li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>
  <li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside of the group community.</li>
  <li><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of members with a wide range of backgrounds, but we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.</li>
  <li><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and our groups are no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of the group comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harassment of any participants in any form</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
<li>Logging or taking screenshots of online activity for harassment purposes</li>
<li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person</li>
<li>Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
<li>Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban</li>
<li>Sexual language and imagery in online communities or in any conference venue, including talks</li>
<li>Insults, put downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up for ridicule</li>
<li>Excessive swearing</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
<li>Unwelcome physical contact, including simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop</li>
<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events</li>
<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
<li>Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Weapons Policy:</strong> No weapons are allowed at Rocky Python events. Weapons include but are not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.</p>

                        <p>If you have questions about this code of conduct, don't hesitate to contact the <a href="mailto: rockypython@googlegroups.com">Code of Conduct Committee</a>.</p>
