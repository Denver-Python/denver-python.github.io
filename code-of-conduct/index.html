<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>Denver Python, Data Science, and Biology are communities intended for learning, networking, and collaboration and has members with different backgrounds and perspectives from all over the greater Denver area and beyond.</p>

<p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to organizers as well as members.</p>

<p>This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Denver Python, Data Science, and Biology respectively. This includes Discord, mailing lists, and virtual or in-person events. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.</p>

<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing <a href="mailto: rockypython@googlegroups.com">rockypython@googlegroups.com</a>.</p>

<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li> -->
<!--   <li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li> -->
<!--   <li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside of the group community.</li> -->
<!--   <li><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of members with a wide range of backgrounds, but we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: -->
<!--     <ul> -->
<!--       <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li> -->
<!--       <li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li> -->
<!--       <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li> -->
<!--       <li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").</li> -->
<!--       <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li> -->
<!--       <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li> -->
<!--       <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li> -->
<!--       <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li> -->
<!--     </ul> -->
<!--   </li> -->
<!--   <li><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and our groups are no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of the group comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.</li> -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<ul>
    <li><strong>Being open.</strong> Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise.</li>
    <li><strong>Focusing on what is best for the community.</strong> We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.</li>
    <li><strong>Acknowledging time and effort.</strong> We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.</li>
    <li><strong>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.</strong> We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.</li>
    <li><strong>Showing empathy towards other community members.</strong> We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.</li>
    <li><strong>Being considerate.</strong> Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users.</li>
    <li><strong>Being respectful.</strong> We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.</li>
    <li><strong>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.</strong> When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Using welcoming and inclusive language.</strong> We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.</li>
    <li><strong>Inappropriate Behavior.</strong> Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
		<ul>
            <li>Harassment of any participants in any form</li>
            <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
            <li>Logging or taking screenshots of online activity for harassment purposes</li>
            <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
            <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person</li>
            <li>Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
            <li>Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban</li>
            <li>Sexual language and imagery in online communities or in any conference venue, including talks</li>
            <li>Insults, put downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up for ridicule</li>
            <li>Excessive swearing</li>
            <li>Unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
            <li>Unwelcome physical contact, including simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop</li>
            <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>
            <li>Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events</li>
            <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
            <li>Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Weapons Policy</strong> Weapons are not allowed at Rocky Python events. Weapons include but are not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.</li>
